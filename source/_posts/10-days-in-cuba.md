## Before Going

#### Books and Resources
Pick up a copy of [Lonely Planet](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/cuba) for Cuba before you go. It is hard to go wrong with this book, there are a ton of great recommendations when it comes to food, accommodations and transportation.  

Before going I would also recommend brushing up on the interesting Cuban history and culture. A couple documentaries I enjoyed watching are [Cuba and the Cameraman](https://www.netflix.com/ca/title/80126449) and [Cuba: The Forgotten Revolution](https://www.netflix.com/ca/title/80101991).

#### Currency in Cuba
Cuba interestingly has two currencies: the Cuban peso (CUP) and the Cuban convertible peso (CUC). The value of one CUC (pronounced *kook*) is fixed to the American dollar and is worth roughly 25 times a CUP. The CUC was introduced in 1994 and is mostly used by the tourism industry. Bring cash to exchange into CUCs once you arrive at the airport in Cuba. I brought Canadian dollars. If you can avoid bringing U.S dollars I would do so because they charge an extra 10% fee to convert USD to CUC. 

At the end of your trip, convert any left over CUCs you have at a bank in the city before heading to the airport. The airport won't exchange your CUCs back to dollars.

#### Will there be internet?
Plan on enjoying a disconnected experience while you are there. You can get WiFi at a lot of hotels and large resorts but in general you probably won't have much access while you are roaming around Cuba. If you do plan on using WiFi you will need to purchase a card from [ETECSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ETECSA), the monopoly telco provider in Cuba. Some hotels providing WiFi sell them onsite, otherwise you can find an ETECSA store to purchase a card for 1-2 CUCs for an hour of WiFi.

#### Where to stay
If you are looking to stay away from big resorts in Cuba, there are more than enough options to stay at [*casa particulares*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casa_particular) (private houses) for a good price. There are so many in Old Havana that you would be pretty safe finding same day accommodations by knocking on the door of a home with the *casa particular* symbol shown above the door in the image below.

We found nice and comfortable *casa particulares* in Havana and Viñales for 25 - 40 CUCs a night without pre-booking any of the accommodations.

#### How to get around
It is fairly easy to get rides with locals or taxis and there is a bus company [Viazul](https://www.viazul.com/) which can get you between cities and towns in Cuba.

## Exploring Cuba in 10 days
#### Day 1 - 4
Fly into the [Havana Airport](http://havana.airportcuba.net/) and spend the first few days experiencing the culture, music scene, art and history in Havana. Three nights was a good amount of time to get to know Old Havana fairly well, go running along the Malecón, visit la *Plaza de la Revolución*, drive through Vedado and drink many 4 CUC mojitos. I would recommend staying in or around *Habana Vieja* (Old Havana). You can easily spend a couple of days walking around this area exploring the [four main plazas](http://cubatoursandtravel.com/destinations/the-four-plazas-of-old-havana/) and dining at one of the many [paladars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paladar) (which refers to the privately owned non-government run restaurants in Cuba). You'll have plenty of opportunity to get a ride in a 50 year old American classic car as taxi drivers are lined up along the streets of Havana waiting to give tourists a ride. Getting a ride around the city with an English speaking guide (unless your Spanish is good!) in an old convertible is a nice way to find your bearings in the city and get to some of the areas outside of Old Havana that are not walking distance.
