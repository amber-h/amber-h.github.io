  Hey! I'm <a href="https://twitter.com/amber_ht" target="_blank">Amber</a>, a <span class='highlighted'>software developer</span> at <a href="http://thoughtworks.com" target="_blank">ThoughtWorks</a>. While I love working as a consultant in the software industry, what I love even more is finding time outside my 9 - 5 job for travel and fun adventures. Planning trip after trip can be very time consuming, especially if you want to fit a lot in with little time. I end up spending A LOT of time searching the web for useful tips when traveling to a new place and sometimes it is difficult to find everything I am looking for. I want to create a space to share things that I've learnt from traveling to some really amazing places which can hopefully be useful to you as you are thinking about planning your next adventure!

  Over the last several years I've spent roughly over <span class='highlighted'>300,000 miles</span> traveling in airplanes (more than enough miles to get me to the moon!) and have had wonderful opportunities to visit <span class='highlighted'>28 different countries</span>. Hopefully I can find a few interesting things to share here! Happy Reading.
